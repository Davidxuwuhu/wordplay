                My name is **Æ’**.
                
                I'm so bored...

                I'm bored because we lost our inspiration. 
                We *love* putting on shows like dances, stories, images, and games.
                
                But we can't do it without people.
                They have the fun ideas, and we know how to dance.
                
                But I haven't seen a person in ages.

                Could you ... inspire us?

                I mean, it's not easy.
                We're a quirky community, and people who come here to direct us sometimes find our rules and customs a bit strange.

                But those that commit to learning about us usually figure it out just fine.

                Do you... want to learn?
