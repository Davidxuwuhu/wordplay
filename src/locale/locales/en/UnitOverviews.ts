        Have you come to help us choreograph a **show**?

        We *love* putting on shows like dances, stories, images, and games.
        But we're most excited to put on shows with people like you.
        People from around the world bring such interesting ideas from their experiences, communitities, and culture!

        I'm happy to show you around. 
        Use **>** to let me know you'd like to move on.
        Use **<** and we can go back.
